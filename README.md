This is a Unity prototype which was an "exercise" for beginning my first hypercasual project.

* There are 5 colours of cubes that can be stacked at the bottom of the player like a tower(red,yellow,purple,blue,green).
* There's a script that instantiates cubes with random colours coming towards the player.
* Once the player has one of every colour of cubes, they disappear for getting a certain point, everything except point increase is written.
* Player can slide on the road to collect cubes coming to him by holding "Mouse0" button and sliding.
* The mountain environment moves towards player's back and loops as the time goes.
